# genus-zero-headline (#30): `genus X = 0 ↔ X ≃ₜ S²`

Unit: genus-zero-headline (`clean_room_blueprint.md`, `docs/design/serre-duality-tails.md` §9.1's
"genus-0 single-simple-pole consequence" + `docs/design/proper-map-degree.md`'s own consumer
note). Assembles the two already-built halves:

* **Backward** (`X ≃ₜ S² ⇒ genus X = 0`): `RS.SphereTopology.genus_eq_zero_of_homeo_sphere`
  (`sphere-topology`, BUILT — pure topology: any space homeomorphic to the sphere is simply
  connected, hence has vanishing holomorphic 1-forms).
* **Forward** (`genus X = 0 ⇒ X ≃ₜ S²`): riemann-roch's `riemann_inequality` at `D := single P 1`
  under `genus X = 0` forces `l(single P 1) ≥ 2 > 1 = l(0)`, so `L(0) = span{1}` is a PROPER
  subspace of `L(single P 1)` (`SetLike.exists_of_lt`, the `CanonicalForms/Existence.lean`
  pattern) — any witness `φ` outside `L(0)` has `φ.ord ≥ -1` at `P`, `φ.ord ≥ 0` elsewhere
  (`mem_linSys_iff`), and `φ.ord P < 0` (else `φ` would be holomorphic everywhere, hence in
  `L(0) = span{1}` by `linSys_zero_eq_span_one`, contradiction); combined with `φ.ord P ≥ -1` this
  forces `φ.ord P = -1` exactly — a single simple pole, no other poles. `proper-map-degree`'s
  already-built `RS.homeoSphere_of_exists_simple_pole` closes it.

## Exports

* `RS.GenusSphereHeadline.exists_simple_pole_of_genus_eq_zero` — the forward-direction finisher.
* **`genus_eq_zero_iff_homeo`** (root level, `docs/Jacobian_challenge.lean:54-56` verbatim, same
  standing variables — a direct alias target for final assembly).

/-- **The forward-direction finisher**: `genus X = 0` produces a meromorphic function with
exactly one simple pole (order `-1` at some `P`) and no other poles (order `≥ 0` elsewhere) —
`RS.homeoSphere_of_exists_simple_pole`'s exact hypothesis shape. -/
