# `periodSubgroup` membership (Forster §21.2)

Unit: period-lattice-rank (`docs/design/period-lattice-rank.md` §6.1). `periodSubgroup X` is
*defined* (jacobian-construction, `Periods.lean`) as the `AddSubgroup.closure` of the range of
`periodVector (basis X)` over based loops at the fixed basepoint `Classical.arbitrary X`. Forster's
`Per(ω₁,…,ω_g)` is literally this range (periods are additive under loop concatenation, so the
range is already subgroup-closed); this file packages that range directly as an `AddSubgroup` and
shows it equals `periodSubgroup X`, which is what Stage C of `Discreteness.lean` needs: a lattice
element must come from a SINGLE based loop, not merely from the closure abstractly.

Main declarations: `RS.periodRange X`, `RS.periodSubgroup_eq_periodRange`,
`RS.mem_periodSubgroup_iff`.
