# Identity theorem for 1-form coefficients (§6.4)

Unit: period-lattice-rank (`docs/design/period-lattice-rank.md` §6.4). A self-contained clopen
propagation argument: if `η ∈ Form1 X`'s preferred-chart coefficient at some point vanishes on a
whole neighborhood, `η = 0` identically. Needed by `Nondegeneracy.lean`'s maximum-principle route
(the last step, replacing Forster's Thm 19.4).

Main declaration: `RS.form1_eq_zero_of_eventually_coeffIn_zero`.

chart vanishes near some nearby point of the set (chart-transport again), hence vanishes on a
whole convex ball around the chart's center (`AnalyticOnNhd.eqOn_zero_of_preconnected_of_
