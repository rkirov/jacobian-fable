# `IsPrimitiveAlongMap`: primitives of a 1-form along a continuous map (CC6)

Unit: paths-and-integrals (`docs/design/paths-and-integrals.md` §2.1–2.2). One generic predicate
serves paths, homotopy squares, and restrictions to subintervals/edges (via `comp`).

Main declarations:
* `RS.IsPrimitiveAlongMap K η F s` — near every `a ∈ s` (within `s`), `F` factors as `g ∘ e ∘ K`
  for a maximal-atlas chart `e` at `K a` and a planar local primitive `g` of `coeffIn e η`.
* Basic API: `.mono`, `.add_const`, `.congr`, `.congr_map`, `.continuousOn`, `.comp`.
* `.rechart` — the chart in the local-primitive data can be re-chosen to any maximal-atlas chart
  containing the image point (the workhorse for uniqueness/gluing/linearity/bridge).
* `.sub_eq_sub` — uniqueness up to a constant: two primitives along the same (continuous) map on
  a preconnected set differ by a constant.
* `.glue` — the junction argument: primitives on `s₁`, `s₂` agreeing at a point of the (preconnected)
  overlap glue to a primitive on `s₁ ∪ s₂`, provided `s₁`/`s₂` cover `𝓝[s₁∪s₂]`-neighborhoods of
  every point (`hcov`).
* `isPrimitiveAlongMap_of_ball` — the constant-chart primitive `g ∘ e ∘ K` on a set mapped by `K`
  into a single chart-ball; the reusable "cell primitive" atom for the 1D chain induction
  (`Continuation.lean`) and the 2D grid (`HomotopySquare.lean`).
