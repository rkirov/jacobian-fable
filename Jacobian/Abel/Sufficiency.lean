# abel-theorem: the sufficiency direction (`docs/design/abel-theorem.md` §4.1 D1, §2.1)

Unit: abel-theorem. Namespace `RS.Abel`. The unit's centerpiece.

## Status: the external blocker (`serre-duality-tails` not existing) has CLEARED; the isolated
hypotheses below are now DISCHARGED modulo that unit's ONE remaining fact

**UPDATE (upgrade-discharge pass)**: `WeakSolutionUpgrade X` and `WeakSolutionUpgradeFinset X ι`
are now PROVEN in `UpgradeDischarge.lean` (`weakSolutionUpgrade_of_surjective` /
`weakSolutionUpgradeFinset_of_surjective`), gated ONLY on `serre-duality-tails`'s single
remaining external fact `Function.Surjective (RS.LaurentTail.tailToH1 (0 : RS.Divisor X))` —
the same gate `DolbeaultBridge.lean` carries. The defs below are kept as the frozen consumer
interface (`period-lattice-rank` cites them); the historical account of the gap follows.

`exists_mero_of_pathIntegral_mem`'s proof is complete through step 4 of the design's own §2.1
proof plan (loop cancellation via `Loops.lean` + the weak solution `f` via
`RS.AbelWeak.exists_weakSolutionOfPair`, fully built — see `AbelWeak/GeneralChain.lean`). Step 6
of the plan (the abstract Dolbeault-upgrade bridge itself, "a vanishing residue pairing forces
`d''`-exactness") is now **fully proved**, `DolbeaultBridge.lean`'s
`exists_dbar_eq_zero_of_forall_basis_pairing_eq_zero`, gated ONLY on
`serre-duality-tails`'s own one remaining external fact
(`Function.Surjective (RS.LaurentTail.tailToH1 (0 : RS.Divisor X))`, a genuine Cousin-I/Mittag-
Leffler-style existence theorem, out of scope for this challenge per `laurent-tails`' own
`Comparison.lean` file-end note) — see that file's docstring for the full account of why the
design's ORIGINAL bridge shape (through `H1Tail.equiv`, the FULL unconditional Čech comparison)
had to be restated at the tail level instead.

**What remains open, and why it is a genuinely different (non-external, new-content) gap from the
one just closed**: design step 5 — packaging a weak solution `f`'s chart-local `d''f/f` data into
one concrete `η : RS.Form01 X`, and PROVING `η` pairs to zero against a basis of `Form1 X` (via
the residue identity, `abel-weak-solutions` §7.3, tied to `f`'s own `GeneralChain` construction) —
was never built by any unit (`abel-weak-solutions` explicitly does not build a global object, by
its own design; this unit's own design doc calls it "this unit's own packaging step", §2.1 step 5,
independent of `serre-duality-tails`). Investigation for this pass (recorded in full in the
build-log) confirmed this is substantial, genuinely new analytic content — assembling a finite
`DbarGlueData`-style cover of `X` compatible with `f`'s own chain construction, and connecting its
pairing to `pathIntegral_eq_sum_chartChain`'s telescoping, tied to `GeneralChain.lean`'s internal
(not exported) chain data — comparable in scope to a further sibling unit, not a short remainder.
It is isolated as PRECISELY as possible below as the single hypothesis `WeakSolutionUpgrade`
(bundling design steps 5 AND 7 — the CR-promotion order bookkeeping of step 7 was investigated in
detail and found tractable, given step 5, via `Jacobian/Dbar/Operator.lean`'s
`contMDiffOn_omega_of_isDbarOn_zero` + mathlib's `Complex.differentiableOn_compl_singleton_and_
continuousAt_iff` removable-singularity theorem + `meromorphicOrderAt_mul`/`_zpow_id_sub_const` —
but was not completed this pass on top of everything else). `WeakSolutionUpgrade`'s docstring
records the exact discharge roadmap: apply the packaging construction to get `η` and its
pairing-vanishing, feed `η` into the NOW-PROVEN `exists_dbar_eq_zero_of_forall_basis_pairing_eq_
zero` to get `u`, then run the (sketched, tractable) step-7 argument.

The **easy/necessity direction** (§2.2, "`∃F` with one simple pole `⟹` `genus X = 0`") is fully
built, no admitted steps: `genus_eq_zero_of_exists_simple_pole` (`WeakToMero.lean`).

/-- **The one remaining, precisely-isolated hypothesis** (see the file docstring): Forster's own
Lemma 20.3 + design §4.1 steps 5 and 7, bundled — given a weak solution `f` of a pair `(P, Q)`
along a path `δ` whose integral against EVERY holomorphic `1`-form vanishes EXACTLY (not just on
a basis; `Loops.lean`'s `exists_zeroPeriod_path` already delivers exactly this strength), `f`
upgrades to an honest meromorphic function with the same simple-zero/simple-pole data. The
ABSTRACT half of this fact (a vanishing residue pairing forces `d''`-exactness) is
`exists_dbar_eq_zero_of_forall_basis_pairing_eq_zero` (`DolbeaultBridge.lean`), PROVEN, gated
only on `serre-duality-tails`'s own remaining external blocker. Discharging `WeakSolutionUpgrade`
in full needs, additionally: (1) package `f`'s chart-local `wirtingerDbar f / f` data into a
global `η : RS.Form01 X` (design §4.1 step 5, e.g. via a `DbarGlueData`-style finite cover tied to
`f`'s own `ChartChain`/`GeneralChain` construction) and show `η` pairs to zero against a basis of
`Form1 X` (via `abel-weak-solutions`' §7.3 residue identity + `pathIntegral_eq_sum_chartChain`,
run against each basis element, using this hypothesis's own zero-period assumption); (2) feed `η`
into `exists_dbar_eq_zero_of_forall_basis_pairing_eq_zero` (supplying its own
`Function.Surjective (RS.LaurentTail.tailToH1 (0 : RS.Divisor X))` gate) to get
`u : RS.SmoothC X` with `RS.dbar u = η`; (3) set `F := fun z => Complex.exp (-(u z)) * f z` and
promote to genuine holomorphy off `Q` (design §4.1 step 7) via
`Jacobian.Dbar.Operator.contMDiffOn_omega_of_isDbarOn_zero` (applied on the open set `{Q}ᶜ`, using
`wirtingerDbar_exp_neg_mul_eq_zero`, ALREADY BUILT in `WeakToMero.lean`, for the `IsDbarOn F 0`
hypothesis off `{P, Q}`, plus a short direct `wirtingerDbar f P = 0` computation from `f`'s own
`IsWeakSolutionAt f P 1` local model to extend `IsDbarOn` across `P` too), package as
`MeroGermOn.mk F hF : RS.Mero X`, and read off the order claims from `f`'s known local models via
`ordAtX_eq_of_mem_source`'s chart-invariance (no rechart needed) + `meromorphicOrderAt_mul`/
`meromorphicOrderAt_zpow_id_sub_const` at `P`, and (using mathlib's
`Complex.differentiableOn_compl_singleton_and_continuousAt_iff` removable-singularity theorem to
extend holomorphy of the local `ψ`-cofactor across the puncture) similarly at `Q`. Investigated
and found tractable in outline this pass (recorded above and in the build log) but not completed
on top of everything else — this is precisely the boundary of what this pass closed. -/
