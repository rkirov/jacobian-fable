# `genus (OnePoint ℂ) = 0` (CC5)

Unit: projective-line (`docs/design/projective-line.md` §3.5, proof plan P8). The coefficients
of a holomorphic 1-form on `ℙ¹`, read in `coeChart` and `invChart`, are entire functions `f`, `g`
related by `f z = -(z ^ 2)⁻¹ * g z⁻¹` for `z ≠ 0`. Since `g` is bounded near `0` (continuity), `f`
decays to `0` at infinity, hence vanishes identically by Liouville; the same transition rule then
forces `g ≡ 0`. So there are no nonzero holomorphic 1-forms on `ℙ¹` — the sphere has genus 0.
