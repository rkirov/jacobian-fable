# abel-theorem: Abel's theorem (Forster 20.7, dissection-free), `ofCurve_inj`

Unit: abel-theorem (`docs/design/abel-theorem.md`). Blueprint #29: "Abel's theorem (Forster 20.7,
dissection-free): the two-point Abel–Jacobi value is nonzero for distinct points on `g ≥ 1`, hence
`ofCurve` is **injective**." Namespace `RS.Abel` for the internal proof pipeline; `Jacobian` for
the challenge-shaped final exports. No fundamental-polygon/cut-surface machinery anywhere (the
blueprint's ⚠ is honored); no `Jacobian.Monodromy`/`Jacobian.FormTrace` import anywhere in this
unit (confirmed at build time, matching the design's DAG audit §3).

**Status**: design steps 5-7 (the `WeakSolutionUpgrade`/`WeakSolutionUpgradeFinset` content —
packaging a weak solution's chart-local `∂̄log f` data into a global `Form01 X`, the vanishing
pairing, the `∂̄`-correction, and the CR-promotion/order bookkeeping) are now **DISCHARGED**
(`AreaPairing.lean` + `SerreFunctional.lean` + `ChartSupported.lean` + `LogPiece.lean` +
`LinkData.lean` + `UpgradeDischarge.lean`, this pass), gated ONLY on `serre-duality-tails`'s one
remaining external fact `Function.Surjective (RS.LaurentTail.tailToH1 (0 : RS.Divisor X))` — the
SAME single gate `DolbeaultBridge.lean` already carries, so the unit's total gate set has
SHRUNK to that one fact (plus `period-lattice-rank`'s `[DiscreteTopology]` instance, that
unit's job): `RS.Abel.weakSolutionUpgrade_of_surjective : (surjectivity) → WeakSolutionUpgrade X`
and `RS.Abel.weakSolutionUpgradeFinset_of_surjective` (the `k`-point form), consumed by the new
`Jacobian.ofCurve_inj_of_surjective'`/`ofCurve_inj_of_surjective`. The blueprint's routing
decision #2 "honest integration atom" — the Dolbeault-side Serre functional
`(σ, θ) ↦ ∬_X σ ∧ θ` — is BUILT (`RS.Abel.pairing`), with the compact-surface Stokes vanishing
(`pairing_dbar_eq_zero`, unconditional), the conjugate-form positivity injection
(`pairingDual_injective`, unconditional, Hodge-free), and the integral-pairing bridge
(`exists_dbar_of_forall_pairing_eq_zero`, same single gate). `scripts/check.sh Jacobian/Abel`
reports **zero sorries**.

## The AbelWeak gap closure (authorized edit, not part of this unit's own files)

This unit's design (`docs/design/abel-theorem.md` §2.1) needs the FULLY GENERAL two-point weak
solution `RS.AbelWeak.exists_weakSolutionOfPair` (for an arbitrary connecting path, not confined
to one chart) — `abel-weak-solutions`' own build pass had explicitly left this as a documented
gap (a missing "rechart" lemma for `IsWeakSolutionAt` across chart transitions). This builder
closed it, as authorized, inside `Jacobian/AbelWeak/` (`Rechart.lean` + `GeneralChain.lean`, zero
sorries, `scripts/check.sh Jacobian/AbelWeak` passes) — see that unit's own root docstring for the
full mathematical account (the removable-singularity-theorem rechart lemma, the general
order-additive `IsWeakSolutionAt.mul`, and the chain induction gluing `SingleChart` pieces at
every breakpoint, including the case where the path revisits its own basepoint).

## API summary

* **`Loops.lean`** (§4.2 D2, §2.1 steps 1-3): `mem_periodSubgroup_iff_exists_loop` (`RS.
  periodSubgroup X`'s generating set is already closed under the loop operations, so its closure
  is exactly the based-loop period vectors, via `AddSubgroup.closure_induction`) and
  `exists_zeroPeriod_path` (the loop-cancellation construction: given `δ`'s basis-period vector in
  `RS.periodSubgroup X`, produces `δ'` with EXACT zero integral against every `ω ∈ RS.Form1 X`,
  not just the basis — extended via `RS.pathIntegralₗ` + `Module.Basis.ext`). Zero sorries.

* **`WeakToMero.lean`** (§4.2 D2, §2.1 step 7, §2.2): `wirtingerDbar_exp_neg_mul_eq_zero` (the
  `∂̄F = 0` computation for `F := exp(-u) * f`, via `wirtingerDbar_mul` + a new holomorphic-outer
  chain rule for `Complex.exp` built from mathlib's `HasDerivAt.comp_hasFDerivAt`) and
  `genus_eq_zero_of_exists_simple_pole` (Forster's necessity shortcut, composing the ALREADY-BUILT
  `RS.homeoSphere_of_exists_simple_pole` + `RS.SphereTopology.genus_eq_zero_of_homeo_sphere` —
  `form-trace-tower` is not imported anywhere in this unit, confirming the design's DAG-audit
  finding). Zero sorries.

* **`DolbeaultBridge.lean`** (§4.3 D3, restated at the tail level): `formDualEquiv` (the perfect
  pairing `Form1 X ≃ₗ[ℂ] Dual (H1Tail 0)`, unconditional) and
  `exists_dbar_eq_zero_of_forall_basis_pairing_eq_zero` (the abstract bridge itself — a vanishing
  residue pairing forces `d''`-exactness — PROVEN, gated only on
  `Function.Surjective (RS.LaurentTail.tailToH1 (0 : RS.Divisor X))`, `serre-duality-tails`'s own
  remaining external fact). Zero sorries.

* **`Sufficiency.lean`** (§4.1 D1, the unit's centerpiece): `exists_mero_of_pathIntegral_mem` (the
  two-point sufficiency direction) and `genus_eq_zero_of_pathIntegral_mem` (the composed
  necessity-direction corollary `ofCurve_inj'` consumes), both gated on the explicit hypothesis
  `RS.Abel.WeakSolutionUpgrade X` (design steps 5+7, the packaging-into-`Form01`-plus-CR-promotion
  content — see that def's docstring for the precise, investigated-but-not-completed discharge
  roadmap). **Also built**: the `k`-point `Finset` generalization
  (`RS.Abel.exists_mero_of_periodVector_mem`, design §4.1), gated on the analogous
  `RS.Abel.WeakSolutionUpgradeFinset X ι` — steps 1-4 (the `k`-point loop-cancellation against the
  TOTAL period, a weak solution per pair via `exists_weakSolutionOfPair`, and Forster's Lemma 20.1
  multiplicativity assembling the product via the ALREADY-BUILT `isWeakSolutionOfFinset_prod`) are
  fully proved, no gate beyond `WeakSolutionUpgradeFinset` itself. Zero sorries throughout.

* **`AreaPairing.lean`** (routing decision #2's atom, foundation): `SurfPoU X` (finite smooth
  PoU subordinate to preferred-chart sources), the biholomorphic `(1,1)`-density change of
  variables `integral_eq_integral_transition` (`normSq (deriv τ)` Jacobian, the residue-theorem
  design's spike-verified `det_fderiv_eq_normSq_deriv`), and the Serre area pairing
  `RS.Abel.pairing PU σ θ = ∑ i, ∫ ψᵢ σᵢ θᵢ dA` with integrability and bilinearity. Zero sorries.

* **`SerreFunctional.lean`**: `pairing_dbar_eq_zero` (compact-surface Stokes: `∬ ∂̄u ∧ θ = 0`,
  PoU-globalized planar Atom 1, unconditional), `conjForm`/`pairingDual_injective` (the
  positivity injection `Form1 X ↪ Dual (H01 X)`, unconditional, no Hodge theory),
  `finrank_H01_eq_genus` and `exists_dbar_of_forall_pairing_eq_zero` (the INTEGRAL-pairing
  Dolbeault bridge — a `(0,1)`-form pairing to zero against every holomorphic `1`-form is
  `∂̄`-exact), the latter two gated on the single `serre-duality-tails` fact. Zero sorries.

* **`ChartSupported.lean`**: `ChartSupportedData.form` (a compactly-chart-supported planar
  `(0,1)`-coefficient spreads to a global `Form01 X`) and the localization
  `pairing_form : pairing PU D.form θ = ∫ h · coeffIn e θ dA`; the inverse-derivative units
  `deriv_trans_mul_deriv_trans_symm`/`deriv_trans_ne_zero`. Zero sorries.

* **`LogPiece.lean`** (planar, no manifold imports): `LogPieceData` (one `SingleChart`-style
  interpolated piece `(z-β)/(z-α) ⇝ exp(χL) ⇝ 1`), its `∂̄log` coefficient `dlog` with
  `∂̄g = dlog · g`, the punctured-limit factorizations at the zero/pole, and
  **`integral_dlog_mul`** — Forster's Lemma 20.3/20.5 in planar form:
  `∫ dlog · θ dA = π (Gp β - Gp α)` via the annulus-Stokes atom + circle integration by parts +
  the Cauchy integral formula. Zero sorries.

* **`LinkData.lean`**: `exists_link` (one chain link ⇒ piece function + packaged `Form01` +
  smoothness/non-vanishing/`∂̄log`-matching/factor-limits/pairing-identity), the planar
  promotion lemma `meromorphicAt_of_tendsto_factor` (punctured holomorphy + factor limit pin
  `meromorphicOrderAt` — the `Rechart`-free order bookkeeping), and the `∂̄` finite product
  rule. Zero sorries.

* **`UpgradeDischarge.lean`** (the discharge): `exists_mero_of_sum_pathIntegral_eq_zero` (the
  Abel sufficiency engine: finitely many zero-total-period paths ⇒ a meromorphic function with
  exactly the endpoint divisor) and **`weakSolutionUpgrade_of_surjective` /
  `weakSolutionUpgradeFinset_of_surjective`** — `WeakSolutionUpgrade X` and
  `WeakSolutionUpgradeFinset X ι` PROVEN, gated only on
  `Function.Surjective (RS.LaurentTail.tailToH1 (0 : RS.Divisor X))`. Zero sorries.

* **`OfCurveInj.lean`** (§4.4 D4): `Jacobian.ofCurve_inj'` (gated on
  `[DiscreteTopology (RS.periodSubgroup X)]`, Forster 21.4(i) exactly — proved via the frozen
  ordering-resolution bridge `AddSubgroup.isClosed_of_discrete` + `AddSubgroup.
  topologicalClosure_minimal`/`le_topologicalClosure`, spike-verified in the design §9 — AND on
  the explicit hypothesis `RS.Abel.WeakSolutionUpgrade X`) and `Jacobian.ofCurve_inj` (same two
  gates — see the file's own docstring for why the design's literal UNGATED final shape cannot be
  stated until `period-lattice-rank` registers the instance globally AND
  `WeakSolutionUpgrade X` is proved). Zero sorries.

## Notes for `period-lattice-rank` (#31), the primary consumer

1. **The `k`-point sufficiency direction IS now exported** (`RS.Abel.exists_mero_of_
   periodVector_mem`, design §4.1/§6 — this design's own finding, §1.4, is that Forster 21.4(b)'s
   own proof needs this general form, not just the two-point case), gated on
   `RS.Abel.WeakSolutionUpgradeFinset X ι` (the `Finset` analogue of `WeakSolutionUpgrade`, same
   remaining content, see `Sufficiency.lean`'s docstring).
2. Once `period-lattice-rank` proves discreteness (Forster 21.4(b), which itself CITES this
   unit's sufficiency direction — see the design's §1.2 ordering-resolution account), please
   register **both** `instance : DiscreteTopology (RS.periodSubgroup X)` (feeds `ofCurve_inj'`
   directly) and `instance : DiscreteTopology (RS.periodSubgroup X).topologicalClosure` (feeds
   `jacobian-construction`'s existing gates) — both are cheap corollaries of the same
   discreteness proof via `AddSubgroup.isClosed_of_discrete` (§4.4/§9 of the design).
3. **Final assembly discharge shape**: once (1) `RS.Abel.WeakSolutionUpgrade`/
   `WeakSolutionUpgradeFinset` are proved (design steps 5+7 — `serre-duality-tails`'s own external
   blocker has already cleared, see `DolbeaultBridge.lean`) and (2) the
   `DiscreteTopology (RS.periodSubgroup X)` instance above is registered globally,
   `Jacobian.ofCurve_inj` becomes literally callable with NO explicit hypothesis/instance argument
   — the exact statement at `docs/Jacobian_challenge.lean:99` is already what `ofCurve_inj'`'s
   conclusion states verbatim, so final assembly is a zero-content rewrap, not new proof work.
4. **Exact `k`-point export signature** (for direct citation):
