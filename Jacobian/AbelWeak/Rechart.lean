# Rechart: `IsWeakSolutionAt` is chart-independent, and general order-additive multiplication

Unit: abel-weak-solutions, closing the gap recorded in this unit's own root docstring and in
`docs/design/abel-theorem.md` §1.4/§4.1 (task: authorized edit inside `Jacobian/AbelWeak/`). The
missing piece for the general multi-chart `exists_weakSolutionOfPair` was a "rechart" lemma:
`IsWeakSolutionAt`'s local model, witnessed in one `maximalAtlas` chart, can be re-witnessed in
ANY OTHER `maximalAtlas` chart at the same point, via mathlib's removable-singularity theorem
applied to the transition map's divided difference (`dslope`). This file builds that lemma
(`exists_localModel_of_isWeakSolutionAt`) and its main consumer, a fully general order-additive
multiplication (`IsWeakSolutionAt.mul`): combining `IsWeakSolutionAt f a k1` and
`IsWeakSolutionAt g a k2` (witnessed in POSSIBLY DIFFERENT charts) gives a function `h`, equal to
`f * g` everywhere except possibly at `a` itself, with `IsWeakSolutionAt h a (k1 + k2)`.

**The junk-value subtlety** (why `h` cannot always literally be `f * g`): `IsWeakSolutionAt`'s
local model is a FULL-neighbourhood equality `f =ᶠ[𝓝 a] fun x => ψ (e x) * (e x - e a) ^ k`,
which pins down the actual value of `f` at `a` itself via the `zpow`-at-zero junk convention
(`0 ^ k = 0` for `k ≠ 0`, `0 ^ 0 = 1`). For `k1, k2` both nonzero with `k1 + k2 = 0` (the
"cancellation" case genuinely needed by the chain induction: a `+1`-order zero of one piece
meeting a `-1`-order pole of the next), `(f * g) a = f a * g a = 0 * 0 = 0` (both individual junk
values), but the model at order `0` demands the value at `a` be `ψ (e a) * φ (e a) ≠ 0` (the
correct removable-singularity limit). So `f * g` and the desired weak solution of order `k1 + k2`
genuinely disagree AT `a` in this case; `Function.update` at the single point `a` repairs this,
uniformly for every `k1, k2` (no case split needed: `Function.update`'s value
`ψ (e a) * φ (e a) * (0 : ℂ) ^ (k1 + k2)` matches BOTH the cancelling case, `= ψ (e a) * φ (e a)`
when `k1 + k2 = 0`, AND the generic case, `= 0`, matching what the naive product already gives).

/-! ## The rechart lemma -/

omit [T2Space X] in
/-- **The rechart lemma**: `IsWeakSolutionAt f a k`'s local model, witnessed by SOME chart `e`, is
also witnessed by ANY OTHER `maximalAtlas` chart `e'` at `a`. Proof: the transition map
`S := e ∘ e'.symm` is holomorphic (chart compatibility) hence `AnalyticAt`; its "divided
difference" `H := dslope S (e' a)` is `AnalyticAt` too (`HasFPowerSeriesAt.
has_fpower_series_dslope_fslope`), agrees with `S`'s derivative at `e' a` (`dslope_same`), and
that derivative is NONZERO because `S` has a two-sided holomorphic inverse (the reverse
transition `T`), so `T ∘ S = id` near `e' a` forces `(deriv T (S (e' a))) * (deriv S (e' a)) = 1`
by the chain rule. The unconditional identity `sub_smul_dslope` (`(b - a) • dslope f a b
= f b - f a`, no case split on `b = a`) then gives the exact factorisation
`e x - e a = (e' x - e' a) * H (e' x)` needed to rewrite the local model. -/
