# `homeoSphere_of_exists_simple_pole` (proper-map-degree, file 3 of 3)

Unit: proper-map-degree (`docs/design/proper-map-degree.md` §3.3). The meromorphic-function
version of degree-1 ⇒ homeomorphism: a single simple pole (no other poles) forces the induced
`ℙ¹`-valued map `RS.MTrace.toP1 f` to have degree exactly `1`, hence `X ≃ₜ ℙ¹ ≃ₜ S²`. This is
genus-zero-headline's forward-headline finisher: the caller (riemann-roch's genus-0
single-simple-pole existence result) supplies `φ` and the pole location `Q`, nothing else.
`φ ≠ 0`/nonconstancy of `φ` are *derived*, not required — `φ.ord Q = -1` alone already rules out
both. This file has zero dependency on `MeromorphicTrace/ArgumentPrinciple.lean`
(unlike `DivisorDegreeZero.lean`): the nonconstancy witness here is the explicit pole location `Q`
itself, cheaper than the general codiscrete-nonconstancy argument.

Main declaration: `RS.homeoSphere_of_exists_simple_pole`.
