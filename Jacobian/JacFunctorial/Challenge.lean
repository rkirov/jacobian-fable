# Challenge-signature pushforward exports (jacobian-functoriality §9, pushforward half)

Unit: jacobian-functoriality. `Jacobian.pushforward_contMDiff` — holomorphy of the pushforward
map, free from `jacobian-construction`'s `Jacobian.contMDiff_inducedHom`, inheriting its
`[DiscreteTopology (periodSubgroup _).topologicalClosure]` gate transparently (the same gate
every other `Jacobian _` manifold instance and `ofCurve_contMDiff` already need — no new gate
introduced here).

**Scope note**: `pushforward_id_apply`/`pushforward_comp_apply` (needing `Torus.inducedHom_id`/
`_comp`, not built upstream — confirmed absent from `Jacobian/JacobianConstruction/Torus.lean` by
this unit's own research) and the full pullback-direction exports (`Jacobian.pullback`,
`pullback_contMDiff`, `pullback_id_apply`, `pullback_comp_apply`, `pushforward_pullback`) are
**not built in this unit** — see the root file's LEDGER and this builder's final report for the
precise gap (`Form1.trace`'s branch-point analyticity and the trace–path-integral relation).
