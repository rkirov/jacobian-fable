# The backward headline: `X ≃ₜ S² ⇒ genus X = 0` (CC-sphere-topology, design §4)

Unit: sphere-topology (`docs/design/sphere-topology.md` §4). Assembles the topological fact
(`SimplyConnectedP1.lean`: any space homeomorphic to `OnePoint ℂ`, in particular to the challenge
sphere, is simply connected) with the analytic fact (`GlobalPrimitive.lean`: a simply connected
compact Riemann surface has genus `0`) into the exact backward-headline signature consumed by
`genus-zero-headline`.

Main declaration: `RS.SphereTopology.genus_eq_zero_of_homeo_sphere`.

/-- The backward headline half (consumed by `genus-zero-headline` alongside Riemann–Roch's
forward half). Only `X`'s TOPOLOGY is used to get `SimplyConnectedSpace X`; `genus X = 0` then
uses `X`'s OWN complex structure via `GlobalPrimitive.lean` — consistent, since `Form1 X`/
`genus X` are defined from `X`'s own atlas, not from the sphere's. -/
