# Compat: small `MForm` helpers needed by residue-theorem (candidates for canonical-forms)

Unit: residue-theorem (`docs/design/residue-theorem.md`). Per CONVENTIONS.md's Compat rule and
the task brief's file discipline, these three one-step corollaries of canonical-forms' frozen
quotient API live in a clearly-marked NEW file rather than editing `Jacobian/CanonicalForms/`:

* `RS.MForm.resAt_eq_zero_of_ord_nonneg` — residues vanish where the order is nonnegative
  (the §1.2 gap flagged in the residue-theorem design; `RS.resAt_of_order_nonneg` composed with
  the definition of `MForm.resAt`).
* `RS.MForm.finite_setOf_ord_neg` — the pole set of a meromorphic 1-form on a compact surface
  is finite (via the divisor's finite support; no connectedness needed).
* `RS.MForm.finite_support_resAt` — hence `resAt` has finite support.

Request filed in `docs/requests/canonical-forms.md`-spirit: these belong upstream eventually.
