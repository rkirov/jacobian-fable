# residue-theorem: the `ℙ¹` base case — atoms (file 1/1, PARTIAL DELIVERY)

Unit: residue-theorem (`docs/design/residue-theorem.md` §6, `docs/design/form-trace-tower.md`
§RationalOnP1). Target headline: `∑ᶠ p, θ.resAt p = 0` for `θ : MForm (OnePoint ℂ)`, as the
genus-0 base case feeding the general-`X` reduction via a nonconstant map to `ℙ¹` (design §6).

**Status: the headline theorem is NOT proved here — read this note before building on this
file.** What follows is a complete (no open goals anywhere), independently useful collection of
atoms toward
it, plus an honest account of the one remaining gap and how to close it. See `Jacobian/
ResidueTheorem.lean` (unit root) for the full write-up of what is/isn't delivered and why.

## What IS built, zero sorries

* `RS.P1.formOfCoeFn`: packages an arbitrary meromorphic "coefficient in the finite chart"
  function `R : ℂ → ℂ` into a genuine `MFormData (OnePoint ℂ)`, given that its
  `invChart`-transported
  reading `fun w => -(w²)⁻¹ * R w⁻¹` is *also* meromorphic. The two-chart `compat` check reduces to
  "apply the transition rule twice returns to the start", independent of what `R` is.
* `RS.P1.coeffAt_coe_eq_coeffAt_coe`: any `MFormData (OnePoint ℂ)`'s finite-chart coefficient is
  the *same raw function* at every finite basepoint (all of `ℙ¹`'s finite points share `coeChart`).
* **The Liouville-free residue-at-infinity fact** (`RS.P1.circleIntegral_inv_eq_neg` +
  `RS.P1.resAt_neg_sq_inv_mul_comp_inv_eq_zero`): for `R_mid` differentiable on all of `ℂ`, the
  residue "at infinity" of its `invChart` reading vanishes — via Cauchy's theorem (an entire
  function's circle integral is `0` at every radius) transported through the `z ↦ z⁻¹` reindexing
  of the contour, NOT a polynomial-growth/degree argument. This is the "Liouville" ingredient the
  task brief anticipated, done more cheaply than the growth-bound route the non-quotient
  `form-trace-tower` design had budgeted for.
* `RS.P1.meromorphicAt_neg_sq_inv_mul_sub_inv_zpow` / `RS.P1.resAt_neg_sq_inv_mul_sub_inv_zpow`:
  the "companion pole at `∞`" bookkeeping for a single principal-part monomial `(w⁻¹ - a) ^ k`
  (`k < 0`) — meromorphic at `0`, with residue `-1` for the simple pole `k = -1` (Miranda's
  "`dz/(z-a)` has residues `1` at `a` and `-1` at `∞`") and `0` otherwise.

## What is NOT built: the assembly, and why (read before attempting it)

The intended proof: extract `θ`'s finite-chart coefficient `R`, subtract the finite sum of its
principal parts at its finitely many finite poles (`RS.principalPartAt`, already built) to get a
remainder `R_mid`, apply the Liouville-free fact above to conclude the remainder's residue at `∞`
vanishes, then telescope (the tail's own residue at `∞` is exactly minus the sum of residues it
reproduces at the finite poles it was built to match, by `resAt_neg_sq_inv_mul_sub_inv_zpow`).

**The blocker, found late and not resolved in the time available**:
`resAt_neg_sq_inv_mul_comp_inv_eq_zero`
needs `R_mid` genuinely `Differentiable ℂ` — but `R_mid := R - R_tail` is built from `MeromorphicAt`
data, whose junk convention at a pole/removable point does **not** force the value there to match
the analytic-repair limit (`MeromorphicAt f x` with witness order `n > 0` puts no constraint on
`f x` at all, since it is multiplied by `(x - x) ^ n = 0`). So `R_mid`, built by bare pointwise
subtraction, may fail to be *continuous* at the finitely many points of `θ`'s pole set even though
its *order* is `≥ 0` there (checked and proved separately, via `MeromorphicAt.orderAt_sub_
principalPartAt_nonneg` + a `Finset.analyticAt_fun_sum` argument — that part of the assembly DID
work, it is only the final "hence `Differentiable ℂ`, hence apply the Liouville-free fact" step
that does not follow as stated). Two fixes, either workable, neither attempted:
(a) weaken `resAt_neg_sq_inv_mul_comp_inv_eq_zero` to take an explicit radius `R₀` with
`R_mid` differentiable only on `closedBall 0 R₀ \ {0}` for `R₀` small enough to exclude the
(finite) pole set — the circle-integral argument only ever needs one such disk, and `resAt` at `0`
doesn't care which; or (b) repair `R_mid` first (canonical-forms' `MeroGermOn.holoRepr`-style
construction, already used elsewhere in this project, e.g. `MForm.d`) to an honestly continuous
representative before invoking Cauchy's theorem. Route (a) is probably the smaller patch — the
`Set.Finite`/`Metric` "there is a positive radius smaller than the nearest nonzero pole" lemma is
routine, and every other piece of the assembly (the finite-pole-sum construction, the order-≥0
argument, the `θ.coeffAt ∞` transition formula, the finite pole set extraction from `θ.divisor`)
was fully worked out and test-compiled during this build and is recorded in this design's build
notes for the next attempt; none of it is included here as code because it was written against the
now-known-insufficient `Differentiable ℂ R_mid` hypothesis and would need re-threading through
whichever fix is chosen.
