# Planar Montel theorem (holomorphic-forms unit)

This file proves **Montel's theorem** in compactness form for the complex plane, together with
the Cauchy derivative estimate feeding it. It is deliberately free of any manifold imports so
that `finiteness-and-chi` (compact-operator argument) can import it cheaply.

Main declarations:
* `RS.norm_deriv_le_of_bounded` — Cauchy estimate: `‖deriv g z‖ ≤ C / r` for `g` holomorphic and
  bounded by `C` on an open set containing `closedBall z r`.
* `RS.montelFamily Ω K C` — restrictions to a compact `K` of functions holomorphic on `Ω ⊇ K`
  and bounded by `C` there, as a subset of `C(K, ℂ)`.
* `RS.isCompact_closure_montelFamily` — the closure of `montelFamily Ω K C` is compact in
  `C(K, ℂ)` (Cauchy estimate ⇒ equicontinuity ⇒ Arzelà–Ascoli).
