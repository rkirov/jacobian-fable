# `genus` (CC1, design §2.1) — root-level, exact challenge signature

Unit: holomorphic-forms (`docs/design/holomorphic-forms.md`). `genus X` is the dimension of the
space of global holomorphic 1-forms `RS.Form1 X`. This is the most load-bearing definition of the
project: it is stated at the **root** namespace with the **exact** signature demanded by
`docs/Jacobian_challenge.lean` (`ConnectedSpace X` is carried only to match that signature — it is
not needed for finiteness, see `Jacobian/Forms/Finiteness.lean`).

Main declarations:
* `genus` — `Module.finrank ℂ (RS.Form1 X)`, honest by the `FiniteDimensional` instance of
  `Jacobian/Forms/Finiteness.lean`.
* `genus_eq_zero_iff_subsingleton` — `genus X = 0 ↔ Subsingleton (RS.Form1 X)`.
