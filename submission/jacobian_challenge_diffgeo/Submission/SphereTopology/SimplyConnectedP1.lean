# `SimplyConnectedSpace (OnePoint ℂ)` (CC-sphere-topology, design §2)

Unit: sphere-topology (`docs/design/sphere-topology.md` §2). No van Kampen: `OnePoint ℂ`'s two
polar caps `{∞}ᶜ`/`{↑0}ᶜ` are each homeomorphic to `ℂ` (hence simply connected), and the
paths-and-integrals unit's loop-perturbation lemma `RS.Loop.exists_homotopic_avoiding` pushes any
based loop off whichever of `∞`/`↑0` is NOT its basepoint, landing it inside one of the two simply
connected caps.

**Note on `RS.Loop.exists_homotopic_avoiding`**: this file was written and compiled against that
lemma's *stated* signature while `Jacobian/Path/Perturb.lean` still carried one documented
placeholder step upstream (the general multi-chart induction, design risk R4 of
paths-and-integrals). That placeholder has since been resolved upstream (see `docs/build-log.md`,
"Perturb.lean FIXED"), so this file now consumes a fully proved lemma; nothing here needed to
change.

Main declarations:
* `RS.SphereTopology.isSimplyConnected_compl_infty`/`isSimplyConnected_compl_coeZero`.
* `instance : PathConnectedSpace (OnePoint ℂ)`.
* `RS.SphereTopology.simplyConnectedSpace_onePoint` (the headline instance).
* `RS.SphereTopology.simplyConnectedSpace_of_homeoOnePoint` (homeomorphism transfer).
* `RS.SphereTopology.simplyConnectedSpace_sphere` (the challenge sphere model).
