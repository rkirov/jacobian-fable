# `basis`, `periodVector`, `periodSubgroup` (CC9)

Unit: jacobian-construction (`docs/design/jacobian-construction.md` §Periods, `core-choices.md`
CC9). Fixes the basis of `Form1 X` used throughout the unit and packages the period subgroup
`Λ ≤ (Fin (genus X) → ℂ)`, the ℤ-span of the period vectors of based loops at a fixed (but
arbitrary) basepoint. Basepoint-independence is not re-proved here (it is a corollary of
paths-and-integrals' `RS.period_conj`, not needed downstream): any two basepoints give loop sets
whose period vectors generate the *same* subgroup, via connecting paths and conjugation, so the
choice of basepoint below is immaterial to `periodSubgroup`.

Main declarations:
* `RS.basis X : Module.Basis (Fin (genus X)) ℂ (RS.Form1 X)` — `Module.finBasis`, so that
  `Fin (Module.finrank ℂ (Form1 X)) = Fin (genus X)` definitionally (`genus` *is*
  `Module.finrank ℂ (Form1 X)`, holomorphic-forms' `Genus.lean`).
* `RS.periodSubgroup X : AddSubgroup (Fin (genus X) → ℂ)` — `AddSubgroup.closure` of the range of
  `periodVector (basis X)` over based loops at a fixed basepoint.
