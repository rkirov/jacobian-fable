# The `→ₜ+` functoriality substrate, wrapped through the `ULift` shell (§9.4)

Unit: jacobian-construction. Wraps `Torus.inducedHom`/`Torus.contMDiff_inducedHom` (the abstract
`V ⧸ L → V' ⧸ L'` substrate, §9.2–§9.3) through the `ULift` shell to produce a `→ₜ+` map
`Jacobian X →ₜ+ Jacobian Y` from a `ℂ`-linear map `T` between the ambient period spaces
respecting the period subgroups.

**Out of scope for this unit** (flagged, not silently dropped, per design §9.4/R4): constructing
the *specific* `T` for a given holomorphic `f : X → Y` (via pullback-of-forms), and the actual
`Jacobian.pushforward`/`Jacobian.pullback` challenge definitions built from a real `f`. No
blueprint unit currently owns "pullback of holomorphic `1`-forms along a holomorphic map" — see
this unit's final report for the flag to the orchestrator.

/-- A `ℂ`-linear map on the ambient period spaces, respecting the period subgroups (at the raw,
undiscretized `periodSubgroup` level — the natural hypothesis to check for a map arising from a
holomorphic `f : X → Y`, e.g. via naturality of periods under post-composition), induces the
functoriality substrate `Jacobian X →ₜ+ Jacobian Y`. The *closure*-level hypothesis
`Torus.inducedHom` needs is derived from this one via minimality of the topological closure
(`AddSubgroup.topologicalClosure_minimal`), since `(periodSubgroup Y).topologicalClosure` is
already closed and `T` is continuous (finite-dimensional). -/
